## Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)

This project utilizes Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) to streamline the development and release process.

### What is CI?
Continuous Integration (CI) is the practice of automatically integrating code changes from multiple contributors into a shared repository. It involves running automated builds and tests whenever code changes are pushed.

### What is CD?
Continuous Deployment (CD) is the process of automatically deploying the application to a testing or production environment after successful CI.

### Implementation
This project is set up with GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Here's how it works:
- *Build and Test:* On every push to the main branch, GitHub Actions automatically triggers a build and test workflow. This ensures that the codebase is always in a working state.
- *Artifact Upload:* After a successful build, the resulting artifacts (e.g., compiled app) are uploaded as GitHub Actions artifacts. These artifacts can be downloaded for further testing or deployment.
- *Testing Deployment:* Optionally, the workflow can include deployment steps for testing purposes. For example, deploying the app to TestFlight for beta testing.
- *Release Deployment:* In a production setup, you might extend the workflow to deploy the app to the App Store or other distribution platforms.
  
### How to Access Build Artifacts

1. Navigate to the [Actions](https://github.com/riiruchi/Travel-Journey/actions) tab in this repository.

2. Click on the latest workflow run.

3. In the workflow run details, locate the "Artifacts" section.

4. Download the desired build artifact for testing or distribution.

### Uploading to TestFlight

To upload the iOS app to TestFlight for beta testing, follow these steps:

1. *Build the App Locally:*
   - Clone or fork this repository.
   - Open the Xcode project: open iOS---Blog-App.xcworkspace.
   - Build the app locally to ensure there are no issues.

2. *Download Build Artifact:*
   - Follow the steps mentioned above to download the latest build artifact from GitHub Actions.

3. *Upload to TestFlight:*
   - Open Xcode.
   - Archive the app: Product > Archive.
   - In the Xcode Organizer, click "Distribute App" and choose "App Store Connect."
   - Follow the prompts to upload the build to TestFlight.

4. *Beta Testing:*
   - Once uploaded, invite testers via the App Store Connect website.
   - Testers will receive an invitation to install the app via TestFlight.

That's it! You've successfully implemented CI/CD and uploaded your iOS app to TestFlight for beta testing.

Feel free to customize this section based on your specific CI/CD setup and TestFlight process. If you have any specific details or steps you'd like to include, please adjust accordingly.
